Unisa Connect
=============

If you had already branched/pulled the repository, remember to rebranch from the new 'androidstudio' branch.
Simply import it in AndroidStudio and it should work without any hassle. 
Most dependencies are handled by Gradle, and the other needed libraries are included in the libs folder.

Get Unisa Connect for Android on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.fdev.unisaconnect)
